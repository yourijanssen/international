  "Aboutdes": "Hi! My name is Youri Janssen, and I am a full-stack developer currently finishing up my education at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. Previously, I studied Arts & Economics at HKU, where I completed enrollment but ultimately decided my future lay elsewhere, specifically in programming. My interest in software development has always been there but I failed to recognize this at an early age. During my final graduation project at the HKU, I created a prototype website/webshop for a struggling soccer club alongside a comprehensive business plan. This project introduced me to the world of web development and I decided this was a field of work I'd be interested to work in for the long-term. This led me to enroll at HVA. Today, I consider myself a proficient programmer with a solid grasp of key concepts. I am always actively seeking opportunities in this field!",
